Tip-light
=========

This is a lightweight JS tooltip plugin. I plan on returning to this project in the near future and giving it a complete make-over as well as add a pure CSS version.

Installation is simple, include Font-Awesome in your project, and add the following html structure:
<xmp>
<!-- currently js looks for a <I class=’fa-info-circle’> for our trigger --> 
<i class='fa fa-info-circle fa-2x'>
  <span class='tool-content'>Your text goes here</span>
</i>
<!-- This is simply a blank container for the mobile version. In the future, I will be adding code that will automatically take care of this, but for now, go ahead and include it. -->
<div class='thumb-tip'></div>
</xmp>
